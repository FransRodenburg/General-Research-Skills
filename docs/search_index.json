Rodenburg Â© 20202021 Universiteit Leiden Preface Every year there are several students without immediate access to the university course material. In addition, students will lose access to old course material eventually. To address these issues, as well as to improve expectation management, this online version of the entire course is being developed. You can view each days lectures, exercises, and references to the book. This online course is a continuation of the biostatistics portfolio. The portfolio, as well as the online version of the course are a work in progress. Please check back later for updates. Always consult Brightspace for the latest information on the schedule, the course material and the exam.

To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio. (Even if you have an existing version, I recommend getting the latest version using the guide below.) 1.1 Lecture: Installation Guide If youre comfortable with computer software, it boils down to: Install R; Install RStudio; Open RStudio and try to knit a template R markdown file. If you cant knit to PDF, see the note below and try knitting to HTML instead. Note about TinyTeX TinyTeX is not required for this course. If you want to knit to PDF, you have to install TinyTeX. This has several advantages over HTML and Word, which are explained in the second video. For the portfolio, all you need is a working version of RStudio, and to be able to knit to HTML. Note about installation problems in general To ensure a smooth experience throughout the course, address installation issues early on. If youre following this course in the context of your biology education at Leiden University, you can always contact Dr. H.G.J. van Mil or me about installation issues. Otherwise, see the general tips below, or try asking a question on Stackoverflow. Some general tips that will save you a lot of headaches with software during your education: Setting your system language to English (Windows, Mac) makes everything a lot easier to find; If you store data in Excel, setting the decimal separator to a dot (.) instead of a comma (,) will also save you a lot of extra effort; If you are on Windows, I highly recommend working on an account with administrator rights and setting user account control to Never notify. (Link says Windows 7 &amp; 8, but it works the same for Windows 10.) 1.2 Lecture: RStudio &amp; R Markdown Watch the video on the RStudio interface below. 1.3 Lecture: The R Language There are two great tutorial for learning the basics in R. This video shows how to use them: 1.4 Exercises Every day there will be exercises in RStudio to teach you how to program, how to run your own analyses and how to interpret output. The optional exercises are for those who want to improve their statistics beyond what is required to pass the course. 1.4.1 Exercise: swirl Watch the part about swirl and complete chapters 1, 2, 4, 7 &amp; 8 from the R Programming course. 1.4.2 Exercise learnr (optional) Most data scientists use the tidyverse. This is a collection of packages aimed at writing code in a more tidy manner, using the pipeline notation. Complete the Data basics, Filter observations, Create new variables and Summarise Tables chapters from the learnr package as explained in the video. (If you dont see a Tutorial tab, try running install.packages(\"learnr\") in the console and then restart RStudio.) From here on out, I will assume basic familiarity with R syntax and the RStudio interface. "],["statistical-tests.html", "Day 2 Statistical Tests 2.1 T-Test 2.2 Chi-Squared Test 2.3 F-Test 2.4 Multiple Testing", " Day 2 Statistical Tests How do you calculate test statistics, what do they mean, and when is something significant? This chapter covers everything you need to know about significance testing for GRS, including the \\(t\\)-test, \\(\\chi^2\\)-test, \\(F\\)-test and multiple testing correction. 2.1 T-Test A test for comparing two group means. The data-generating process is assumed to follow a normal distribution, given the group. 2.1.1 Choosing the right \\(t\\)-test Watch part 1 of the \\(t\\)-test lecture and answer the questions below. 2.1.2 Exercises Suppose you measured the beak dimensions (length, depth) of three Geospiza fortis and three Geospiza scandens finches. Copy the code below to enter the example data into R: fortis_length &lt;- c(11.00, 10.60, 11.43) fortis_depth &lt;- c(9.70, 9.30, 10.28) scandens_length &lt;- c(12.90, 14.20, 14.00) scandens_depth &lt;- c(7.90, 9.10, 8.80) Is there a significant difference in mean beak length at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)? Use an appropriate \\(t\\)-test. Is there a significant difference in mean beak depth at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)? Use an appropriate \\(t\\)-test. If you use a Wilcoxon test instead of a \\(t\\)-test, how does this affect your conclusion? Suppose you measure three juvenile G. fortis finches, tag them, and then measure them again once they reach adulthood: juvenile_length &lt;- c(8.69, 7.69, 8.11) juvenile_depth &lt;- c(9.44, 7.22, 8.38) adult_length &lt;- c(11.50, 9.70, 10.40) adult_depth &lt;- c(9.50, 8.00, 8.80) Is there a significant difference in mean beak length at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)? Use an appropriate \\(t\\)-test. Is there a significant difference in mean beak depth at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)? Use an appropriate \\(t\\)-test. 2.1.3 Understanding how the \\(t\\)-test works Watch part 2 of the \\(t\\)-test lecture and answer the questions below. 2.1.4 Exercises Interpreting output is an important part of the exam. The questions on the exam will usually be no harder than this, so if you get these right, your understanding of the subject matter is sufficient. (If you want to review specific parts of the video, there are chapters if you watch it in a separate window.) Below is the (partial) output of a \\(t\\)-test. What kind of \\(t\\)-test is this? t = -1.8608, df = 17.776, p-value = 0.07939 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -3.3654832 0.2054832 sample estimates: mean in group 1 mean in group 2 0.75 2.33 Use the output shown above to determine what the standard error (\\(\\text{SE}\\)) was. Below is the output of another \\(t\\)-test on the same data. What kind of \\(t\\)-test was used here? t = -1.8608, df = 17.776, p-value = 0.0397 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is less than 0 95 percent confidence interval: -Inf -0.1066185 sample estimates: mean in group 1 mean in group 2 0.75 2.33 Compare the \\(p\\)-value of the first and second \\(t\\)-test. What do you notice? What was the total sample size of the data used in the \\(t\\)-test below? t = -4.9005, df = 38, p-value = 1.811e-05 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -8.994387 -3.735613 sample estimates: mean in group 1 mean in group 2 19.735 26.100 Using your answer from (5) and the output, can you calculate the standard deviation (\\(s\\))? 2.2 Chi-Squared Test A test for comparing observed to expected frequencies (counts). Can also be used for contingency tables. 2.2.1 Lecture Watch the lecture on the \\(\\chi^2\\)-test and answer the questions below. 2.2.2 Exercises 2.3 F-Test A test for comparing two variances. The variances are assumed to belong to variables which follow a normal distribution. 2.4 Multiple Testing If a study involves testing more than one hypothesis, then there is an increased chance of a false positive. 2.4.1 Lecture Watch the lecture on multiple testing and answer the questions below. 2.4.2 Exercises Suppose a paper compares \\(10\\) different diets with paired \\(t\\)-tests (before and after), to find out which diets result in a significant reduction in fat mass. If a level of significance \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is used and no multiple testing correction is applied, what is the chance of at least one false positive? Suppose these are the results of the paper described in the previous question: Copy the code below to your R markdown file and answer the following questions: pvalues &lt;- c(`diet 1` = 0.06936, `diet 2` = 0.81778, `diet 3` = 0.94262, `diet 4` = 0.26938, `diet 5` = 0.16935, `diet 6` = 0.03390, `diet 7` = 0.17879, `diet 8` = 0.64167, `diet 9` = 0.02288, `diet 10` = 0.00832) Which diets have a significant effect after Bonferroni correction? Which diets have a significant effect after FDR correction? Why are some \\(p\\)-values equal to \\(1\\) after correction? There have been many criticisms of the over-reliance of scientific papers on \\(p\\)-values. This is in part because there are many incorrect interpretations being used in papers, and in part because problems like multiple testing, stopping rules and stepwise regression are often left unaddressed. This is one of the major reasons for the ongoing reproducibility crisis. Which of the following interpretations of the \\(p\\)-value are incorrect (more than one answer possible)? The \\(p\\)-value is the chance of a false positive; The \\(p\\)-value is the chance that the null-hypothesis is false; The \\(p\\)-value is the chance that the null-hypothesis is correct; The \\(p\\)-value is the chance that the alternative hypothesis is false; The \\(p\\)-value is \\(1\\) minus the chance that the alternative hypothesis is correct; The \\(p\\)-value is the probability that the results arose by chance; The \\(p\\)-value is the chance that the test statistic is this large, or larger, if the null-hypothesis were correct; If the null-hypothesis were true, and the experiment were repeated a large number of times, then the \\(p\\)-value is the expected proportion of experiments with this larger, or larger a test statistic. A solution proposed by some groups is to lower the commonly used standard of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) to some lower value, like \\(\\alpha = 0.005\\). Why is this solution problematic? What would be a better solution?
