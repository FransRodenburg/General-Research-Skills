(*)", " Chapter 3 ANOVA Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a model for comparing any number of group means. The observations are assumed to be independent, deviations from the group means are assumed to follow a normal distribution, and group variances are assumed to be equal. 3.1 Overview Watch part 1 of the ANOVA lecture and answer the questions below. 3.1.1 Exercises The PlantGrowth data set is included with the default installation of R. It contains \\(30\\) independent measurements of dry weight from plants subjected to three types of treatment. You can view it by running View(PlantGrowth) in the console, or you can see the structure of the data and produce a summary of the data like this: str(PlantGrowth) summary(PlantGrowth) Make a plot showing the weight of the different groups. You can use the same kind of plot as shown in the video. Fit an ANOVA and save it as an object called ANOVA. Here is the code I used in the video to perform visual diagnostics. Run it and comment on the plots.1 require(&quot;car&quot;) # Install if missing par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # Plot in a 2x2 grid plot(ANOVA, which = 1) # Residuals vs fitted qqPlot(ANOVA, reps = 1e4) # QQ-plot. See footnote for errors plot(ANOVA, which = 3) # Scale-location plot(ANOVA, which = 4) # Cook&#39;s distance par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # Restore the default Perform the omnibus test. Is there a difference in weight among any of the groups? Perform a post hoc analysis. Which group means differ significantly? 3.2 How does ANOVA work? Watch part 2 of the ANOVA lecture and answer the questions below. 3.2.1 Exercises Below is the output of an omnibus test of some data: Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Species 2 63.21 31.606 119.3 &lt;2e-16 *** Residuals 147 38.96 0.265 What is the number of groups? What is the total sample size? What does Pr(&gt;F) mean? Here is another omnibus test, but with some values omitted: Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Group x 3488 697.5 z 0.000277 *** Residuals 48 5745 y What is the value of x? What is the value of y? What is the value of z? Why do we bother with an omnibus test, why not just use the post hoc immediately after fitting the model? 3.3 Two-Way, Multi-Way &amp; Interaction Watch part 3 of the ANOVA lecture and answer the questions below. 3.3.1 Exercises 3.4 Where is part 4? (*) When you use two- or multi-way ANOVA, Tukeys Honest Significant Difference only corrects for the categories within each explanatory variable. This quickly becomes problematic: If youll recall from the multiple testing lecture, with \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), with as little as three explanatory variables, you will already have a chance of \\(1 - (1 - 0.05)^3 \\approx 14.3\\%\\) chance of at least one false positive among all comparisons. In order to correct for this, you would need to somehow obtain uncorrected \\(p\\)-values from TukeyHSD and then perform multiple testing correction for the total number of comparisons. This is unfortunately not very easy to do, so Dr. van Mil and I decided that it would not be part of the GRS course. We will include this in the Advanced Statistics course for master students. If you are interested, or need this for your internship, please have a look at the vignettes of the emmeans package, or wait for me to release part 4 after the course. What a vignette is, is covered in the video on help files. List of problems and how to fix them: (1) If you get an error about a missing package, install car using install.packages(\"car\"), then run diagnostic plots code again. (2) If you cant install car, replace qqPlot(ANOVA, reps = 10e4) with: plot(ANOVA, which = 2). (3) If you get an error about figure margins being too small, simply enlarge your plot pane as shown here, then run the diagnostic plots code again. "]]
