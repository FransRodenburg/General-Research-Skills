In addition, students will lose access to old course material eventually. To address these issues, as well as to improve expectation management, this online version of the entire course is being developed. You can view each days lectures, exercises, and references to the book. This online course is a continuation of the biostatistics portfolio. The portfolio, as well as the online version of the course are a work in progress. Please check back later for updates. Always consult Brightspace for the latest information on the schedule, the course material and the exam. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Meeting in Teams 1.2 Simple Calculations 1.3 Vectors", " Chapter 1 Introduction This chapter is provided by Dr. H.G.J van Mil. The aim of today is to start working with Teams, R and Rstudio. I assume most of you have both installed. If not, follow the guide on the next page. You can also follow it to get the most up-to-date version. In its simplest form, the R language is similar to a calculator, but it can do much more, especially with respect to statistics. In this short tutorial, I will demonstrate some aspects of the R language, starting with simple computation and then moving to work with vectors and simple plots. Some examples may seem trivially simple, but it is important to get a feel for how R syntax works. Try to experiment by changing the code and predict what will happen or try and find the cause for any errors. But before we start, I want to go to your group, decide who will share the desktop with Rstudio. It is important to learn how to work together and find a way to share your data within a group. 1.1 Meeting in Teams Go to your group channel in Teams and exchange information. You can find the list on Brightspace with all the channel names and members, and join your group in the corresponding channel in Teams. If you do not have access to Brightspace or Teams, Frans or I can add you (provided you are following the GRS course at the IBL). Find out how to share your desktop; Find out how to use the chat function; Find out how to store documents in a way that is accessible for all team members. Possible ways to cooperate on the assignments in teams: One student shares their desktop with RStudio; All channel members work together on the assignments; Exchange codes using the chat function. Write proposed code in the chat and the student that shares their desktop can easily copy-paste it into their Rmd file; In the end, the Rmd and HTML files are shared with all the channel members. In the warm-up assignment below, you could propose alternative or similar codes if necessary. 1.2 Simple Calculations The use of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division is straight forward and equivalent to an old-school calculator. Create a new R markdown file, copy the code below to your clipboard (there is a useful button for this in the upper right corner) and paste it into a new chunk in RStudio. 2 + 3 # summation 23 - 67 # subtraction 33 * 27 # multiplication 891 / 11 # division Once youve pasted the code above into a chunk in an R markdown file, you can put your cursor somewhere in the line that contains the calculation (inside the gray chunk) and press Ctrl + Enter to perform the calculation. Alternatively, you can run all code within a chunk by pressing the green play button in the upper right corner of the chunk. You can also perform more complex calculations by combining different calculations and using brackets to influence the order of evaluation: (2 + 33 * 27) / 14 - 42 2 + 33 * 27 / (14 - 42) Like the old-school calculator, R makes extensive use of functions. As we shall see later on in the course, R has a very large number of functions, most of them specialized for statistical computation. A function consists of two elements: The function itself, with its default arguments; The arguments of the function to be specified. This always take on the following form: function(argument1 = ..., argument2 = ..., etc.), where the arguments form the input of the function. Functions can have one or more arguments, and these arguments may be of different types (numbers, strings of numbers, specific values, matrices, etc.). Some simple example are shown below: 1.2.1 Logarithms log(10) # log is the natural logarithm (base e). log(10, base = exp(1)) # Hence, this line is the same. log10(10) # Base 10 is so common it has its own function, log2(10) # as does base 2. log(125, base = 5) 1.2.2 Exponentials and power functions Note below that we can use a function as an argument within another function (a function can be nested in another function): exp(10) log(exp(10)) # A function inside another function 10^(2+3) # 10**(2+3) will also work log10(10^(2+3)) 1.2.3 Trigonometric functions To see which trigonometric function are available, go to the lower right window in Rstudio and click on the help tab. In the search field on the top right of that window type Trig. Some examples below: cos(pi) sin(1/2 * pi) sin(asin(1/4 * pi)) 1/4 * pi 1.2.4 Functions of a random variable We can generate a random variable in R like this: runif(1) runif(1) runif(1) Note that every time you call the function you get a different random number. Making a random variable would therefore give a different value for everyone: x &lt;- runif(1) This x is a variable that stores the result of runif(1), a random number. A function of a random variable is itself also a random variable. Can you predict the outcome of the function below? 10 * log(1 + runif(1)) 1.2.5 Logical operators You might not have used these on an old-school calculator, but on the more advanced calculators like the graphical calculator, these functions are available. Try to figure out what each of the operators below do and write them down behind the #. If its not clear from the example code here, change the values to see whats happens. &quot;A&quot; == &quot;B&quot; # &quot;A&quot; != &quot;B&quot; # &quot;C&quot; == &quot;C&quot; # &quot;C&quot; != &quot;C&quot; # 2 == 2 # 2 != 2 # 3 &lt; 6 # 3 &lt; 3 # 3 &lt;= 3 # 3 &gt;= 3 # For the other logical operators &amp; (and) and | (or) we need more than one number or symbol. We can make a vector (a sequence of values) of numbers or symbols. Think of this vector as a row in an Excel sheet. This concept of a vector is very important in R when dealing with data. Below we will store these vectors in a variable that can be reused in our calculations. 1.3 Vectors 1.3.1 Creating a vector When you store objects in R with the assign operator (&lt;-), you can then later use those objects. You must run these lines before the exercises after this will work. V1 &lt;- c(3, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) V1 ## [1] 3 2 3 4 6 7 4 6 7 8 9 V2 &lt;- paste(letters[V1]) V2 ## [1] &quot;c&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; In R you can use numeric vectors in calculations: sum(V1) ## [1] 59 log(V1) ## [1] 1.0986123 0.6931472 1.0986123 1.3862944 1.7917595 1.9459101 1.3862944 ## [8] 1.7917595 1.9459101 2.0794415 2.1972246 sin(2 * V1) ## [1] -0.2794155 -0.7568025 -0.2794155 0.9893582 -0.5365729 0.9906074 ## [7] 0.9893582 -0.5365729 0.9906074 -0.2879033 -0.7509872 Do you think that sin(V2) would work? Why? 1.3.2 Logical operators Write in the comments (after #) what happens in the following lines: V1 &gt; 5 &amp; V1 &lt; 9 # ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE V1 &gt; 5 | V1 &lt; 9 # ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE V1 &lt; 5 | V1 &gt; 9 # ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE V2 == &quot;c&quot; | V2 == &quot;e&quot; # ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE V2 == &quot;c&quot; &amp; V2 == &quot;e&quot; # ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE V2 != &quot;c&quot; # ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE V1 != &quot;3&quot; # ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE You can use these logical operator to select specific parts of your data set (subsetting). Here we use square brackets to indicate a location in the vector: V2[V2 != &quot;c&quot;] ## [1] &quot;b&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;i&quot; V1[V1 != &quot;3&quot;] ## [1] 2 4 6 7 4 6 7 8 9 V1[V1 &lt; 5 | V1 &gt; 9] ## [1] 3 2 3 4 4 V2[V1 &lt; 5 | V1 &gt; 9] # Do you get what this one does? ## [1] &quot;c&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;d&quot; For hints see this page. 1.3.3 Simple plots in R Here we use our vector from the previous exercise to create a plot. plot(V1, sin(V1)) You can make this a more complex plot by adding the cosine for the values of V1: plot(V1, sin(V1)) points(V1, cos(V1), col = &quot;blue&quot;, pch = 2) plot(V1, sin(V1), type = &quot;b&quot;) points(V1, cos(V1), col = &quot;blue&quot;, pch = 2, type = &quot;b&quot;) V1 &lt;- sort(V1) plot(V1, sin(V1), type = &quot;b&quot;, ylim = c(-1, 1)) points(V1, cos(V1), col = &quot;blue&quot;, pch = 2, type = &quot;b&quot;) R has far more advanced visualization functions, emphasizing the importance of data visualization in statistical analysis, that we will explore in a later tutorial. That concludes all for the first day. If you want to continue practicing in R, have a look at the paragraph Tutorials on the next page. Tomorrow we start working with more advanced data manipulation methods and higher plot functions. "],["installation-tutorial.html", "Chapter 2 Installation &amp; Tutorial 2.1 Installation Guide 2.2 About RStudio &amp; R Markdown 2.3 About the R Language 2.4 Tutorials", " Chapter 2 Installation &amp; Tutorial Throughout this course, we will use RStudio. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio. (Even if you have an existing version, I recommend getting the latest version using the guide below.) 2.1 Installation Guide If youre comfortable with computer software, it boils down to: Install R; Install RStudio; Open RStudio and try to knit a template R markdown file. If you cant knit to PDF, see the note below and try knitting to HTML instead. Note about TinyTeX TinyTeX is not required for this course. If you want to knit to PDF, you have to install TinyTeX. This has several advantages over HTML and Word, which are explained in the second video. For the portfolio, all you need is a working version of RStudio, and to be able to knit to HTML. Note about installation problems in general To ensure a smooth experience throughout the course, address installation issues early on. If youre following this course in the context of your biology education at Leiden University, you can always contact Dr. H.G.J. van Mil or me about installation issues. Otherwise, see the general tips below, or try asking a question on Stackoverflow. Some general tips that will save you a lot of headaches with software during your education: Setting your system language to English (Windows, Mac) makes everything a lot easier to find; If you store data in Excel, setting the decimal separator to a dot (.) instead of a comma (,) will also save you a lot of extra effort; If you are on Windows, I highly recommend working on an account with administrator rights and setting user account control to Never notify. (Link says Windows 7 &amp; 8, but it works the same for Windows 10.) 2.2 About RStudio &amp; R Markdown Watch the video on the RStudio interface below. 2.3 About the R Language There are two great tutorial for learning the basics in R. This video shows how to use them: 2.4 Tutorials Every day there will be exercises in RStudio to teach you how to program, how to run your own analyses and how to interpret output. The optional exercises are for those who want to improve their statistics beyond what is required to pass the course. 2.4.1 Exercise: swirl Watch the part about swirl and complete chapters 1, 2, 4, 7 &amp; 8 from the R Programming course. 2.4.2 Exercise learnr (optional) Many data scientists prefer the tidyverse over base R. This is a collection of packages aimed at writing code in a more tidy manner, using the pipeline notation. Complete the Data basics, Filter observations, Create new variables and Summarise Tables chapters from the learnr package as explained in the video. (If you dont see a Tutorial tab, try running install.packages(\"learnr\") in the console and then restart RStudio.) From here on out, I will assume basic familiarity with R syntax and the RStudio interface. "],["statistical-tests.html", "Chapter 3 Statistical Tests 3.1 T-Test 3.2 Chi-Squared Test 3.3 Multiple Testing", " Chapter 3 Statistical Tests How do you perform basic comparisons of samples? How do you calculate test statistics, what do they mean, and when is something significant? This chapter covers everything you need to know about basic significance tests for GRS, including the \\(t\\)-test, \\(\\chi^2\\)-test, and multiple testing correction. 3.1 T-Test A test for comparing two group means. The data-generating process is assumed to follow a normal distribution, given the group. 3.1.1 Choosing the right \\(t\\)-test Watch part 1 of the \\(t\\)-test lecture and answer the questions below. 3.1.2 Exercises Suppose you measured the beak dimensions (length, depth) of three Geospiza fortis and three Geospiza scandens finches. Copy the code below to enter the example data into R: fortis_length &lt;- c(11.00, 10.60, 11.43) fortis_depth &lt;- c(9.70, 9.30, 10.28) scandens_length &lt;- c(12.90, 14.20, 14.00) scandens_depth &lt;- c(7.90, 9.10, 8.80) Is there a significant difference in mean beak length at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)? Use an appropriate \\(t\\)-test. Is there a significant difference in mean beak depth at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)? Use an appropriate \\(t\\)-test. If you use a Wilcoxon test instead of a \\(t\\)-test, how does this affect your conclusion? Suppose you measure three juvenile G. fortis finches, tag them, and then measure them again once they reach adulthood: juvenile_length &lt;- c(8.69, 7.69, 8.11) juvenile_depth &lt;- c(9.44, 7.22, 8.38) adult_length &lt;- c(11.50, 9.70, 10.40) adult_depth &lt;- c(9.50, 8.00, 8.80) Is there a significant difference in mean beak length at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)? Use an appropriate \\(t\\)-test. Is there a significant difference in mean beak depth at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)? Use an appropriate \\(t\\)-test. 3.1.3 Understanding how the \\(t\\)-test works Watch part 2 of the \\(t\\)-test lecture and answer the questions below. 3.1.4 Exercises Interpreting output is an important part of the exam. The questions on the exam will usually be no harder than this, so if you get these right, your understanding of the subject matter is sufficient. (If you want to review specific parts of the video, there are chapters if you watch it in a separate window.) Below is the (partial) output of a \\(t\\)-test. What kind of \\(t\\)-test is this? t = -1.8608, df = 17.776, p-value = 0.07939 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -3.3654832 0.2054832 sample estimates: mean in group 1 mean in group 2 0.75 2.33 Use the output shown above to determine what the standard error (\\(\\text{SE}\\)) was. Below is the output of another \\(t\\)-test on the same data. What kind of \\(t\\)-test was used here? t = -1.8608, df = 17.776, p-value = 0.0397 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is less than 0 95 percent confidence interval: -Inf -0.1066185 sample estimates: mean in group 1 mean in group 2 0.75 2.33 Compare the \\(p\\)-value of the first and second \\(t\\)-test. What do you notice? What was the total sample size of the data used in the \\(t\\)-test below? t = -4.9005, df = 38, p-value = 1.811e-05 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -8.994387 -3.735613 sample estimates: mean in group 1 mean in group 2 19.735 26.100 Using your answer from (5) and the output, can you calculate the standard deviation (\\(s\\))? 3.2 Chi-Squared Test A test for comparing observed to expected frequencies (counts). Can also be used for contingency tables. 3.2.1 Lecture Watch the lecture on the \\(\\chi^2\\)-test and answer the questions below. 3.2.2 Exercises Suppose a vaccine is reported to prevent \\(95\\%\\) of virus infections in healthy adults. The vaccine is given to \\(1000\\) healthy adults, all of which are expected to be exposed to the virus. If \\(63\\) individuals end up being infected, is there a significant deviation from the reported effectiveness at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)? Below is a \\(2 \\times 2\\) contingency table: male female left-handed 59 455 right-handed 40 479 With \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), is there a difference in the \\(\\text{male}:\\text{female}\\) ratio of left and right-handed individuals? For larger contingency tables, a \\(p\\)-value alone does not quite paint the picture of what is going on. This is why there have been quite a few attempts to make visual summaries of categorical data. One such example is a mosaic plot. The code below generates a mosaic plot for the hair and eye color frequencies of \\(592\\) individuals.1 Copy the code to R and run it. Can you tell which combinations are less common in females than in males? mosaicplot(HairEyeColor) 3.3 Multiple Testing If a study involves testing more than one hypothesis, then there is an increased chance of a false positive. 3.3.1 Lecture Watch the lecture on multiple testing and answer the questions below. 3.3.2 Exercises Suppose a paper compares \\(10\\) different diets with paired \\(t\\)-tests (before and after), to find out which diets result in a significant reduction in fat mass. If a level of significance \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is used and no multiple testing correction is applied, what is the chance of at least one false positive? Suppose the results of the paper described in the previous question are the ten \\(p\\)-values shown below. Copy the code to your R markdown file and answer the following questions: pvalues &lt;- c(`diet 1` = 0.06936, `diet 2` = 0.81778, `diet 3` = 0.94262, `diet 4` = 0.26938, `diet 5` = 0.16935, `diet 6` = 0.03390, `diet 7` = 0.17879, `diet 8` = 0.64167, `diet 9` = 0.02288, `diet 10` = 0.00832) Which diets have a significant effect after Bonferroni correction? Which diets have a significant effect after FDR correction? Why are some \\(p\\)-values equal to \\(1\\) after correction? There have been many criticisms of the over-reliance of scientific papers on \\(p\\)-values. This is in part because there are many incorrect interpretations being used in papers, and in part because problems like multiple testing, stopping rules and stepwise regression are often left unaddressed. This is one of the major reasons for the ongoing reproducibility crisis. Which of the following interpretations are incorrect? The \\(p\\)-value is: The chance of a false positive; The chance that the null-hypothesis is false; The chance that the null-hypothesis is correct; The chance that the alternative hypothesis is false; \\(1\\) minus the chance that the alternative hypothesis is correct; The probability that the results arose by chance; The chance that the test statistic is this large, or larger, if the null-hypothesis were correct; If the null-hypothesis were true, and the experiment were repeated a large number of times, then the \\(p\\)-value is the expected proportion of experiments with this larger, or larger a test statistic. A solution to the reproducibility crisis proposed by some groups is to lower the commonly used standard of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) to some lower value, like \\(\\alpha = 0.005\\). Why is this solution problematic? What would be a better solution? Below is a comic from xkcd.com. What is meant by this comic? Snee, R. D. (1974): Graphical display of two-way contingency tables.

(*)", " Chapter 4 ANOVA Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a model for comparing any number of group means. The observations are assumed to be independent, deviations from the group means are assumed to follow a normal distribution, and group variances are assumed to be equal. 4.1 Overview Watch part 1 of the ANOVA lecture and answer the questions below. 4.1.1 Exercises The PlantGrowth data set is included with the default installation of R. It contains \\(30\\) independent measurements of dry weight from plants subjected to three types of treatment. You can view it by running View(PlantGrowth) in the console, or you can see the structure of the data and produce a summary of the data like this: str(PlantGrowth) summary(PlantGrowth) Make a plot showing the weight of the different groups. You can use the same kind of plot as shown in the video. Fit an ANOVA and save it as an object called ANOVA. Here is the code I used in the video to perform visual diagnostics. Run it and comment on the plots.2 require(&quot;car&quot;) # Install if missing par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # Plot in a 2x2 grid plot(ANOVA, which = 1) # Residuals vs fitted qqPlot(ANOVA, reps = 1e4) # QQ-plot. See footnote for errors plot(ANOVA, which = 3) # Scale-location plot(ANOVA, which = 4) # Cook&#39;s distance par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # Restore the default Perform the omnibus test. Is there a difference in weight among any of the groups? Perform a post hoc analysis. Which group means differ significantly? 4.2 How does ANOVA work? Watch part 2 of the ANOVA lecture and answer the questions below. 4.2.1 Exercises Are the following statements true or false? The omnibus test is used to see which of \\(k\\) group means differ; The omnibus test is an \\(F\\)-test; The residual variance is smaller than the total variance in the outcome; The \\(p\\)-value is the chance of obtaining an \\(F\\)-value at least this large if there were no differences in group means; The post hoc of a one-way ANOVA must still be corrected for multiple testing. Below is the output of an omnibus test of some data: Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Species 2 63.21 31.606 119.3 &lt;2e-16 *** Residuals 147 38.96 0.265 What is the number of groups? What is the total sample size? What does Pr(&gt;F) mean? Here is another omnibus test, but with some values omitted: Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Group x 3488 697.5 z 0.000277 *** Residuals 48 5745 y What is the value of x? What is the value of y? What is the value of z? Why do we bother with an omnibus test, why not just use the post hoc immediately after fitting the model? 4.3 Two-Way, Multi-Way &amp; Interaction Watch part 3 of the ANOVA lecture and answer the questions below. 4.3.1 Exercises In an experiment on rats, a researcher wanted to find out what the effect would be of the genotype of the biological mother and the foster mother on the growth of the rats.3 \\(61\\) rat litters were taken from their biological mother and placed with a foster mother. See the figure below. Which is suitable here: One-way, two-way, or multi-way ANOVA? Do you expect an interaction or main effects here? Explain. Based on your answer to the previous question, run an appropriate ANOVA for this data set. Perform visual diagnostics, look at the summary, and perform a post hoc analysis. Write a short conclusion. The data set is called genotype and you can access it by loading the package MASS: require(&quot;MASS&quot;) # Comes preinstalled with R str(genotype) summary(genotype) (hard) Search online for the definition of the central limit theorem. Is normality of the residuals a reasonable assumption for this study from a theoretical point of view? (HINT: Look at the help page for the genotype data set and read the description of the outcome variable.) 4.3.2 Additional Exercises (*) The iris data set is included with the default installation of R. It contains \\(150\\) independent measurements of sepal and petal dimensions from three types of Iris species. Choose one of: Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, Sepal.Width and Petal.Width and perform a complete analysis to find out whether species differ on average. In this exercise we are going to calculate how much variance your ANOVA from the previous exercise has explained. Remember the animation from the video: Estimate the total variance in the outcome using var(); Estimate the residual variance. You can obtain the residuals of a model using residuals() on the fitted model; The variance explained is one minus the proportion of the total variance that remains after fitting the model. How much variance did your model explain? If your model is called ANOVA, then you can check your answer as follows: summary(lm(ANOVA))$r.squared. Did you get the calculation right? This value will be explained again in the linear regression lectures. 4.4 Where is part 4? (*) When you use two- or multi-way ANOVA, Tukeys Honest Significant Difference only corrects for the categories within each explanatory variable. This quickly becomes problematic: If youll recall from the multiple testing lecture, with \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), with as little as three explanatory variables, you will already have a chance of \\(1 - (1 - 0.05)^3 \\approx 14.3\\%\\) chance of at least one false positive among all comparisons. In order to correct for this, you would need to somehow obtain uncorrected \\(p\\)-values from TukeyHSD and then perform multiple testing correction for the total number of comparisons. This is unfortunately not very easy to do, so Dr. van Mil and I decided that it would not be part of the GRS course. We will include this in the Advanced Statistics course for master students. If you are interested, or need this for your internship, please have a look at the vignettes of the emmeans package, or wait for me to release part 4 after the course. What a vignette is, is covered in the video on help files. List of problems and how to fix them: (1) If you get an error about a missing package, install car using install.packages(\"car\"), then run diagnostic plots code again. (2) If you cant install car, replace qqPlot(ANOVA, reps = 10e4) with: plot(ANOVA, which = 2). (3) If you get an error about figure margins being too small, simply enlarge your plot pane as shown here, then run the diagnostic plots code again. Bailey, D. W.
